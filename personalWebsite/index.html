            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>As someone with a deep sense of curiosity and a creative spirit, 
                I love spending my free time exploring and learning new things. 
                Whether it's teaching myself how to sketch, experimenting with painting, 
                or picking up new academic and extracurricular skills, I enjoy diving into 
                different interests. While I wouldn’t call myself a bookworm, I’ve managed 
                to read a few books that I truly enjoyed. Below is a list of some of my 
                favorites, which I’d highly recommend to anyone looking for a good read!
                </p>
                <ul class="content">
                    <li>A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini</li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Click to know more</summary>
                        <p>This novel explores the struggles of Afghan women in a male-dominated society. 
                        Through the heartbreaking and powerful stories of Laila and Mariam, it vividly 
                        portrays the harsh realities of life in Kabul, highlighting their resilience 
                        and strength.</p>
                    </details>
                    <li>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelha</li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Click to know more</summary>
                        <p>The story follows the shepherd boy Santiago in his journey 
                        across North Africa to the Egyptian pyramids after he dreams 
                        of finding a treasure there.</p>
                    </details>
                    <li>The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger</li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Click to know more</summary>
                        <p>Originally intended for adults, it is often read by adolescents 
                        for its themes of angst and alienation, and as a critique of 
                        superficiality in society. The novel also deals with 
                        themes of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, 
                        sex, and depression. The main character, Holden Caulfield, 
                        has become an icon for teenage rebellion. Caulfield, 
                        nearly of age, gives his opinion on a wide variety of topics 
                        as he narrates his recent life events.</p>

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>I’m an international student from Bangladesh, and back home, 
                I lived with my parents. Moving here to Canada to live with my brother 
                was a big shift in my life, and at first, the transition was challenging. 
                Adapting to a new culture, a new environment, and a new lifestyle wasn't 
                easy, but over time, things began to change. I started meeting new people, 
                making friends, and gradually found myself embracing this new chapter. 
                Now, I love my life here and have grown much more independent along the way.
                 I’ve discovered the joy of doing things on my own—whether it’s cooking and 
                 experimenting with new recipes, tending to my little garden, or mastering 
                 the art of time management. Balancing studies with household chores has 
                 taught me the value of self-reliance and responsibility, and I truly enjoy
                the process of growing into this new version of myself.
